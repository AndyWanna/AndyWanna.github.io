Hello, I am Andy Wanna, a first year Ph.D. Student at Georgia Tech working as a research assistant in the SHARC Lab under Professor Callie Hao's supervision. I graduated with a Masters of Engineering from Imperial College London in 2024. This website serves as a platform to showcase my technical projects and experiences throughout my time at Georgia Tech and Imperial. My current research interests are in improving and automating hardware design using HLS for modern AI and cryptographic workloads using Equivalence Graphs (E-Graphs). I possess a strong passion for hardware engineering, specifically in the areas of HLS and Design automation, optimized hardware designs for GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs, as well as AI, with a focus on Machine Learning/Deep Learning. You can explore these interests in detail through the various projects, work experience, and CV pages. My ultimate career objective is to contribute to the global endeavor of pushing the boundaries of current technology by offering unique, innovative, and accessible ideas and solutions.

More broadly, some of my hobbies include Formula 1, playing Padel and cooking. More detailed information can be found around the rest of the webpage and feel free to contact me via any of the links below.
